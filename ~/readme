Note: This version incomplete, and have limitations - no settings dialog,
      changed font and colors not saved.

      
  Installation:
  
    Copy systray.dll and systrayd.exe into
    <XWorkplace installation folder>\plugins\xcenter\
    Close, and then re-open XCenter. SysTray widget should be appear
    in widget list as "System tray and clock".

  Description:
  
    System tray widget for XCenter - it's port of System tray plugin
    included in SysTray/WPS to XCenter. (XCenter is a part of XWorkplace.)
    System tray widget for XCenter based on source code of SysTray/WPS.
    SysTray/WPS was developed by Dmitry Zaharov <systray@os2.ru>.
    System tray is a bar with icons which added by thrid-party applications
    using SysTray API. Applications will get messages from user actions
    on tray icons.
  
    
  Hidden feature:
  
    Experimental feature for showing keyboard layout in system tray. You need
    to add SET SYSTRAY_LANGVIEW_LATIN and SET SYSTRAY_LANGVIEW_NATIONAL
    settings into CONFIG.SYS with values referring to icons for 
    national/default keyboard layout images.  Example:
    SET SYSTRAY_LANGVIEW_LATIN=c:\os2\default.ico
    SET SYSTRAY_LANGVIEW_NATIONAL=c:\os2\national.ico
    Do not open Language Viewer from System Setup folder - it will cause total
    functionality lost of system tray keyboard layout viewer until reboot.
	For icons, see folder "lang_ico" which contain icons that I use.
