Installation
------------

Install crypto10.dll, gcc1.dll, gcc446.dll, jpeg.dll, jpeg8.dll, libcx0.dll,
png1616.dll, pthr01.dll, ssl10.dll, z.dll and z1.dll files into one of the
directories on your "LIBPATH" (e.g. 'x:\os2\dll'). You can download archives
with these files from:

    http://rpm.netlabs.org/release/00/zip/libc-0_6_6-26_oc00.zip
    http://rpm.netlabs.org/release/00/zip/gcc-4_9_2_1-3_oc00.zip
    http://rpm.netlabs.org/release/00/zip/openssl-1_0_0r-1_oc00.zip
    http://rpm.netlabs.org/release/00/zip/zlib-1_2_11-1_oc00.zip
    http://rpm.netlabs.org/release/00/zip/pthread-20150408-19_oc00.zip
    http://rpm.netlabs.org/release/00/zip/libjpeg-8c-1_oc00.zip

If you use RPM/YUM, just run this command:

    yum install libc libgcc1 openssl zlib pthread libjpeg libpng

It is recommended to use Extended System Tray Widget (by Dmik) for
eCenter/XCenter with VNC Server:

  ftp://ftp.netlabs.org/pub/qt4/xsystray/xsystray-0_1_1.wpi

or System Tray Widget ver. 0.3 (by ErOs2).


VNC Viewer - client to access remote desktop service
----------------------------------------------------

This package provides a VNC-client for OS/2 Presentation Manager, you can
connect to a VNC-server somewhere in the network and display its content in a
window. VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. 

VNC Client supports UltraVNC advanced features such as file franfering and
chat.

Command line switches for VNC Viewer

  vncviewer.exe [[-h|-l] [-ravcdeoq] ...]

  -h host[:display]          - VNC server. Can be specified multiple times.
  -l [ipaddr|*|any][:port]   - The addresses and port where VNC Viewer will
                               listen for server connection. You may specify
                               this switch multiple times.
  -r <1|Y|YES|ON|0|N|NO|OFF> - Use (1/y/yes/on) stored password or prompt user
                               (0/n/no/off) for the password.
  -a NN                      - Connection attempts (1..10).
  -v <1|Y|YES|ON|0|N|NO|OFF> - View-only mode.
  -c <8|16|32|TrueColor>     - Color depth (TrueColor is 32 BPP).
  -d host[:port]             - Destination host.
  -s <1|Y|YES|ON|0|N|NO|OFF> - Request shared session.
  -e "enc1 enc2 ..."         - Support encodings:
                                 RAW COPYRECT TIGHT HEXTILE ZLIB ZLIBHEX
                                 ZRLE ZYWRLE ULTRA CORRE RRE.
                               First encoding is most prfered.
  -o N                       - Compress level for encodings: TIGHT, ZLIB and
                               ZLIBHEX (0..9).
  -q N                       - Quality level for TIGHT and ZYWRLE (0..9).
  -t "Window title"          - Window title.
  -E charset                 - Server character encoding (for filenames, chat).

  -R                         - Reset fonts & colors in the dialog boxes.

  For all the unspecified switches -ravcdeoq previously stored in GUI or the
  default values will be used.

Examples:

  vncviewer.exe -h 192.168.1.10 -c 16 -o7 -q4
  vncviewer.exe -h 192.168.1.10 -r No -t "Host A" -h myhostb -vON -t "Host B"
  vncviewer.exe -lAny -c32 -eTight

VNC Server - graphical desktop sharing
--------------------------------------

VNC Server transmits a duplicate of the remote computer's display screen to the
viewer. It also interprets commands coming from the viewer and carries them out
on the remote computer.

VNC Server supports UltraVNC advanced features such as file franfering and
chat.

Web Browser Access

Users may access their desktops from any computer with any Java-enabled or
HTML5-capable Web browser, without installing any software on the client
computer. VNC displays a desktop within a browser window by running a Java
applet or uses HTML5 capabilities.

This program based on LibVNCServer library licensed under the GPL.

Command line switches for VNC Server

  -s <properties-open properties-close show hide shutdown>

  -s                         - Send command to the running instanse.
    properties-open          - Open properties notebook.
    properties-close         - Close properties notebook.
    show                     - Show system tray/floating icon.
    hide                     - Hide system tray/floating icon.
    shutdown                 - Shutdown server.


Keyboard Map Utility
--------------------

Client sends keyboard events to the server. The key itself is specified using
the "keysym" values defined by the X Window System, even if the client or
server is not running the X Window System.

VNC Server and VNC Client provided by this package use correspondence tables
to translate system keyboard events to "keysym" values and back. Usualy two
tables are used: "local" table for national keys and additional "general" table
for standart keyboard. Keyboard Map Utility is a program to edit correspondence
tables.

Tables are held in text files .\keysym\*.xk . VNC Server and VNC Client will
try to load files in order: user.xk, NNN.xk, general.xk (where NNN is a system
local page number). Each next loaded file complements common table in memory.
user.xk - top priority, it can be used for your experiments or external
non-standard keypads.

When "local" table (NNN.xk) does not exist, VNC Server and VNC Client will try
to use unicode-related "keysym" values for keys which generate characters.
RFC 6143, "7.5.4. KeyEvent":
  "Modern versions of the X Window System handle keysyms for Unicode
  characters, consisting of the Unicode character with the hex
  1000000 bit set."

Adding support for a new language with Keyboard Map Utility:

  - Open (empty) local table: File -> Open -> Local table (NNN).
  - Record all national characters keys (Record -> Start - many keys).
  - Hold Shift and record all these keys again.
  - Stop recording.
  - Set correspond XK_xxxxx value for each event (Double click on records or
    press enter).
  - Save table: File -> Save.

Note that not all other VNC clients/servers supports national keyboards.
For more detailed information see RFC 6143, 7.5.4. KeyEvent.
